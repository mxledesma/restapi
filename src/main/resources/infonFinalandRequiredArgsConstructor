Here's a concise breakdown of the final keyword in your code and its impact:
Key Differences: Using final vs. Removing It
1. Role of final in Dependency Injection

    With final:
    The @RequiredArgsConstructor (from Lombok) generates a constructor that initializes all final fields. This ensures Spring injects the ExpenseRepository and ModelMapper dependencies automatically.

    java
    // Lombok generates this constructor:
    public ExpenseServiceImpl(ExpenseRepository expenseRepository, ModelMapper modelMapper) {
        this.expenseRepository = expenseRepository;
        this.modelMapper = modelMapper;
    }

    Without final:
    Lombok ignores non-final fields, so no constructor is generated. Without explicit dependency injection (e.g., @Autowired), both fields will be null, causing a NullPointerException at runtime.

2. Immutability

    With final:
    Fields cannot be reassigned after initialization, which is a best practice for Spring service components (prevents accidental modification).

    Without final:
    Fields can be reassigned, increasing the risk of bugs (e.g., accidentally overwriting the repository reference).

3. Will the Code Work Without final?

    No, unless you manually add:

        A constructor with @Autowired, or

        Field injections with @Autowired (not recommended for required dependencies).
